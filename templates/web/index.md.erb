### Purpose

This plugin provides tester models to drive bench debuggers such as the Segger J-Link or PE Micro.

### How To Import

##### To use in an application:

Add the following to your application's <code>Gemfile</code>:

~~~ruby
gem 'rgen_debuggers', '<%= RGen.app.version %>'
~~~

##### To use in a plugin:

Add the following to your plugin's gemspec:

~~~ruby
spec.add_runtime_dependency 'rgen_debuggers', '~> <%= RGen.app.version.major %>', '>= <%= RGen.app.version %>'
~~~

and require the gem in your code:

~~~ruby
require 'rgen_debuggers'
~~~

### How To Use

For JTAG based protocols all that should be required is to change the application target
to instantiate one of the debuggers that support JTAG, such as J-Link or P&E:

~~~ruby
$tester = Debuggers::JLink.new
#  or
#$tester = Debuggers::PEmircro.new
~~~

Patterns should now generate a debugger command file without any additional application
modifications.

### How To Setup a Development Environment

~~~
mkdir <%= RGen.app.config.initials.downcase %>
cd <%= RGen.app.config.initials.downcase %>
dssc setvault <%= RGen.app.config.vault %> .
dssc pop -rec -get .
~~~

Some patterns can be found in the pattern directory to exercise the debuggers.

Follow the instructions here if you want to make a 3rd party app
workspace use your development copy of the <%= RGen.app.config.initials %> plugin:

This plugin also contains a test suite, make sure this passes before committing
any changes!
